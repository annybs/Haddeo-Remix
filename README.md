## Files

`haddeo.scd` is a simple SuperCollider startup file to configure audio routing and load project samples.

`haddeo.tidal` is the full Haddeo (Algorave Remix) composition for Tidal Cycles.

`samples.csv` contains sample attributions. All samples are available in `samples/` directory.

## Snippets

The main `haddeo.tidal` reflects the original composition, and includes 'initial states' of the various patterns used with notes on what should be changed and when. New patterns are prefaced with a comment like `-- @something` declaring its 'key' for reference.

In the `snippets/` directory are [yasnippet](http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/)-compatible snippet files reflecting these references, and additionally a `hsetup` snippet (which contains the project setup) and a `haddeo` snippet that provides a convenient list of all project snippets.

For easy loading and use in emacs Tidal, copy or symlink the snippets into a `haskell-mode` major group in one of your snippet folders.
